A light weight weather application for displaying the weather details of few cities.

**Install Node and Express**

Go to http://nodejs.org and install NodeJS

Go to http://expressjs.com and install Express

Go to https://www.npmjs.org/package/ejs and install ejs

**Run Locally**

1. Unpack weatherapp within your node server. (i.e <node server location>/weatherapp)

2. Run the app:

`node server.js`

Then navigate to `http://localhost:3000/weather`. 

**TO DO:** 

1. All page styling is broken at this point. Since routing happens via node styling issues need to be taken care. 

2. Extend the functionality for displaying weather information for any city.

3. Client app uses twitter bootstrap and it is the display page in the end still doesn't completely exploit all the features. Clean up to be done.
