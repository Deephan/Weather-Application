A light weight weather application for displaying the weather details of few cities.

**Install Node and Express**

Go to http://nodejs.org and install NodeJS

Go to http://expressjs.com and install Express

**Run Locally**

1. Unpack weatherapp with your node server. (i.e <node server location>/weatherapp)

2. Run the app:

`node server.js`

Then navigate to `weatherapp.html` in the weatherapp package. 

**TO DO:** 

1. The app starts from a static html page. This will be replaced with node.js entry point.

2. The site pane has to show the weather for the selected cities instead of displaying it on a new page. 

3. Extend the functionality for displaying weather information for any city.

4. Remove all hardcoded urls provided statically in the client file.

5. Client app uses twitter bootstrap and it is the display page in the end still doesn't completely exploit all the features. Clean up to be done.
