A light weight weather application for displaying the weather details of few cities.

REQUIREMENTS: node.js and express. 

SETUP:

i) Unpack weatherapp with your node server. (i.e <node server location>/weatherapp)


TO DO: 

(i) The site pane has to show the weather for the selected cities instead of displaying it on a new page. 

(ii) Extend the functionality for displaying weather information for any city.

(iii) Remove all hardcoded urls provided statically in the client file.

Execution: 

a) Go to <node source>/weatherapp folder.

b) Type node server.js. Node server listens on port 3000 by default.

c) Go to the weatherapp package and open the weatherapp.html. Note that, this is still not the cleanest way to start the weatherapp. 

d) Click on the cities on the side pane for getting the weather info. Results are tabulated on a new page.
